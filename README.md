# CAPSTONE-PROJECT
EDA on Olympics Dataset using Python and PySpark.

The key objective of the project was to identify which country dominated the Summer Olympics and in which sports category. 

Meaningful insights were extracted by performing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) using Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and PySpark.

The cleansed dataset was transferred to MySQL using SQL Alchemy library and various queries were performed by applying appropriate normalization techniques.

The same cleansed dataset was used in PySpark and various insights like the oldest player,  the country he played for and his age were found out.
